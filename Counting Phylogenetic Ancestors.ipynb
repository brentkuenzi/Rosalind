    "A binary tree is a tree in which each node has degree equal to at most 3. The binary tree will be our main tool in the construction of phylogenies.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rooted tree is a tree in which one node (the root) is set aside to serve as the pinnacle of the tree. A standard graph theory exercise is to verify that for any two nodes of a tree, exactly one path connects the nodes. In a rooted tree, every node vv will therefore have a single parent, or the unique node ww such that the path from vv to the root contains {v,w}{v,w}. Any other node xx adjacent to vv is called a child of vv because vv must be the parent of xx; note that a node may have multiple children. In other words, a rooted tree possesses an ordered hierarchy from the root down to its leaves, and as a result, we may often view a rooted tree with undirected edges as a directed graph in which each edge is oriented from parent to child. We should already be familiar with this idea; it's how the Rosalind problem tree works!\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though a binary tree can include nodes having degree 2, an unrooted binary tree is defined more specifically: all internal nodes have degree 3. In turn, a rooted binary tree is such that only the root has degree 2 (all other internal nodes have degree 3).\n",

    "**Return**: The number of internal nodes of any unrooted binary tree having nn leaves."
